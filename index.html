                    Education is the driving force behind every country’s economy, directly or indirectly. 
                    Sure, schools have adapted to modernization, and have started making students work in groups to solve problems, 
                    learn online and integrate science with arts mostly in the private sector, even at that very few. 
                    But it is noticed even then, students that are graduating lack the advanced skills and innovative thinking 
                    to work through the modern-day challenges in the workplace and positively impact the society at large. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, the purpose of IICHUB, to build youngsters with the capacity to not only look for jobs, 
                    complain about the government, start businesses, but also to think creatively and ambitiously of ways 
                    to give back to the society. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Thus, our model for training for social impact, that way, we can inspire a people who would create 
                    sustainable wealth, not only because it solves a problem but more so because it becomes the reason 
                    for social inspiration in communities to build, to live and to grow. 
                </p>  
                    
                <p>
                    Our Model for Change<br>IICHUB aims to develop strategies that have a long-term positive impact. 
                    By increasing the number of minds exposed to business options, we increase the number of creative, 
                    viable businesses. An approach to this is through the following:<br><br>
                    
                    1.  Entrepreneurship programmes that are occasionally held for students in High schools, with a major 
                    focus on schools that are not technologically inclined. <br><br>
                    
                    THEME: IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF THE GIRL CHILD FOR SOCIAL IMPACT<br>
                    For instance, the programme with the theme “Improving the capacity of the girl child for social impact” 
                    was an approach to reorient teenage girls with the mentality that women cannot make a change in the society, 
                    and to revive teenage girls that have tried and have given up as a result of a lack of zeal, suffered abuse or 
                    discouragements from the opposite sex or from families and/or friends.<br> 
                    These programs provide students the opportunity to discover what they love, and the tools to develop 
                    that into a successful business. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
                <p>
                    As a social enterprise, IICHUB recognizes and addresses these needs, using the very business model 
                    taught in our programs. Introducing young kids to entrepreneurship develops their initiative and helps 
                    them to be more creative and self-confident in knowing what they should and should not embark on acting 
                    in a socially responsible way.<br>
                    Not only do these programs have positive impacts on the individual students, but they have the potential 
                    to affect the community at large. As the country and many Nigerians face difficulties, we give students a 
                    chance to make a difference, inspiring a mindset that stays with them forever.<br><br>
                    
                    2.  Mentorship and Apprenticeship for at risk youngsters.<br><br>
                    
                    For a very long time, a model has existed in Nigeria where artisans or traders take in young people for 
                    apprenticeships. These apprentices learn from hands-on experience and are eventually set up to run their 
                    businesses with seed funding provided by the individual who mentored them. It has been the secret to the 
                    success and the creation of vast commercial distribution hierarchies and networks formed by our culture. 
                    It has enabled commerce and wealth distribution in our part of this world.<br>
                    There is a lot that Nigerian technology can learn from this model. Mark Essien the founder of the Nigerian 
                    Hotels booking platform – hotels.ng has always said – “The best way to learn how to build startups is by 
                    working at one. Our culture has proven this to be right for generations before, we just never saw the 
                    similarity between the pure commerce startup and technology startup. The incubation and acceleration models 
                    are also similar. A technology business is ultimately a business, and there is a lot to learn from those who 
                    have succeeded in building resilient models that have defined our informal local retail and services 
                    industries.<br> So, we have a platform for at risk youngsters for mentorship and apprenticeship.
